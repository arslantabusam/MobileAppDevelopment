# MobileAppDevelopment

This project involves creating an application in JavaScript using the React Native framework. 
Then export the code into an Android application.  In addition to these technologies, during this project,
I have gained an understanding of RESTful APIs and the OpenAPI specification, in addition to 
some experience in interacting with applications developed using NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MySQL.
