# WhatsThat? - Mobile App Development

A **messaging platform** which allows users to communicate with each other. Users sign up for an account with WhatsThat? and can then search for and add contacts and create chats with individuals or groups of contacts. 

This project focuses on creating an application in JavaScript using the React Native framework to an Web Application that interacts with an existing back-end RESFful API. 
Then export the code into an Android application.  In addition to these technologies, during this project I have gained an understanding of RESTful APIs and the OpenAPI specification, in addition to some experience in interacting with applications developed using NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MySQL.
